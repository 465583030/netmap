20110909 notes about linux port of netmap
  + where is the main entry for the character driver /dev/netmap ?
  + i am a bit uncomfortable about adding extra fields to the
    struct net_device (i am under the assumption that other parts
    of the code may access the structure so if the layout changes
    things could be messed up). Now, your "netmap_ptr" is not
    the only conditional field in the structure, but i was wondering
    if there is a better place to store that info.

  + netmap has a 'capability' bit and an 'enable' bit.  In BSD they have
    the same value and are stored in if_capabilities and if_capenable.
	It seems that the logic equivalents for these info are
    respectively 'features' and 'hw_features' though i am a bit
    unclear on that.
