    	Netmap - a framework for fast packet I/O
    VALE -  a Virtual Local Ethernet using the netmap API
===================================================================

NETMAP is a framework for very fast packet I/O from userspace.
VALE implements an equally fast software switch using the netmap API.
Both can deal with line rate on real or emulated 10 Gbit ports.

In this directory you can find source code (BSD-Copyright)
for FreeBSD and Linux. Note that recent FreeBSD distributions
already include both NETMAP and VALE.

Installation instructions 
-------------------------
A kernel module (netmap.ko or netmap_lin.ko) implements the whole
VALE switch and the core NETMAP routines.
Netmap-aware device drivers are needed to use netmap on ethernet ports.
To date, we have support for Intel ixgbe (10G), e1000/e1000e/igb (1G),
Realtek 8169 (1G) and Nvidia (1G).

  FreeBSD
  --------
  + add 'device netmap' to your kernel config file and rebuild a kernel.
    This will include the netmap module and netmap support in the device
    drivers.  Alternatively, you can build standalone modules
    (netmap, ixgbe, em, lem, re, igb)

  Linux
  -------
  + make sure you have kernel sources matching your installed kernel,
    so the build system can patch the sources and build netmap-enabled
    drivers. If kernel sources are in /a/b/c/linux-A.B.C/ , then you should do

	cd netmap/LINUX
	make KSRC=/a/b/c/linux-A.B.C/		# builds the kernel modules
	make KSRC=/a/b/c/linux-A.B.C/ apps	# builds sample applications

    You can omit KSRC if your kernel sources are in a standard place.
  

Applications
-------------
The directory examples/ contains some programs that use the netmap API

    pkt-gen	a packet generator/receiver working at line rate at 10Gbit/s
    bridge	a utility that bridges two interfaces or one interface
		with the host stack
    pcap.c	a simple libpcap-over-netmap library, and some test
		code, to help porting pcap applications to netmap.
		The library compiles as libnetmap.so, you can use it
		to replace your libpcap.so.*
