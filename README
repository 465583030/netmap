    	Netmap - a framework for fast packet I/O
    VALE -  a Virtual Local Ethernet using the netmap API
===================================================================

Netmap is a framework to give direct access to network devices to userland
programs. Details on the system are given at

	http://info.iet.unipi.it/~luigi/netmap/

VALE implements a very fast software switch using the netmap API, see

	http://info.iet.unipi.it/~luigi/vale/

In this directory you can find source code for FreeBSD and Linux.
The code is distributed under a BSD Copyright.
Recent FreeBSD distributions already include both netmap and VALE
so you should not need to use these sources.

Install
-------
Assuming your kernel source tree is in ${BASE}, to build netmap
you should do the following:

   + copy the sources for the the netmap module from sys/ into ${BASE}/sys
     excluding .svn directories (e.g. rsync -aC sys/ ${BASE}/sys)

   + apply the patch in head-netmap.diff
     (it updates some device drivers and config files. Currently tested
     are ixgbe, em, lem and re.
     The patch is for HEAD, but it *might* work also for RELENG_8.

Then you can build kernel adding "device netmap" to the kernel config.
and modules and reinstall it.

The directory examples/ contains some programs that use the netmap API

    pkt-gen	a packet generator/receiver working at line rate at 10Gbit/s
    bridge	a utility that bridges two interfaces or one interface
		with the host stack
    pcap.c	a simple libpcap-over-netmap library, and some test
		code, to help porting pcap applications to netmap.
		The library compiles as libnetmap.so, you can use it
		to replace your libpcap.so.*
