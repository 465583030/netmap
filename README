    	Netmap - a framework for fast packet I/O
    VALE -  a Virtual Local Ethernet using the netmap API
===================================================================

NETMAP is a framework for very fast packet I/O from userspace.
VALE implements a very fast software switch using the netmap API.
Both can deal with line rate on real or emulated 10 Gbit ports.
See details at

In this directory you can find source code (BSD-Copyright)
for FreeBSD and Linux. Note that recent FreeBSD distributions
already include both NETMAP and VALE.

Installation instructions
-------------------------
You need to install a kernel module (netmap.ko or netmap_lin.ko)
which is all you need to use the VALE switch.
If you want to use netmap applications on your network devices you need
to build and load netmap-enabled device drivers.

  FreeBSD
  --------
  + add 'device netmap' to your kernel config file and rebuild a kernel.
    Alternatively, you can build the relevanto modules

  Linux
  -------
  + make sure you have kernel sources matching your installed kernel,
    say they are in /a/b/c/linux-A.B.C/ , then you should do

	cd netmap/LINUX
	make KSRC=/a/b/c/linux-A.B.C/		# builds the kernel modules
	make KSRC=/a/b/c/linux-A.B.C/ apps	# builds sample applications

    You can omit KSRC if your kernel sources are in a standard place.
  

The directory examples/ contains some programs that use the netmap API

    pkt-gen	a packet generator/receiver working at line rate at 10Gbit/s
    bridge	a utility that bridges two interfaces or one interface
		with the host stack
    pcap.c	a simple libpcap-over-netmap library, and some test
		code, to help porting pcap applications to netmap.
		The library compiles as libnetmap.so, you can use it
		to replace your libpcap.so.*
